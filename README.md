# Data provider template project
 
This maven module provides a reference implementation of a typical data provider. Developers can copy this module and use it as a base template for their own development. 

Once the development is done, the project can be built from command line *(mvn clean install)*. Also, in order to make the new provider available in the dashbuilder webapp, the generated *.jar* file must be added to the *dashbuilder.war/WEB-INF/lib* directory.
